          <p>
            Hello! I'm Chidinma Ihejiofor, a passionate web developer on a journey 
            to create accessible and user-friendly web experiences. My love for coding 
            stems from the ability to transform ideas into reality through lines of code. 
            I believe that technology should be inclusive and accessible to everyone, 
            which drives my commitment to learning and implementing best practices in web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring photography, diving into technical 
            books, or continuously learning new technologies. I'm particularly fascinated by 
            how design and functionality can come together to create meaningful digital experiences.

          <h2 class="section-title">Areas I'm Working On</h2>
          <p>
            Growth comes from acknowledging what we don't know yet. Here are areas where 
            I'm actively building my confidence:
          </p>
          <ul class="confidence-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced CSS Layouts:</strong> While I'm comfortable with Flexbox, 
              I'm still mastering CSS Grid for complex, responsive layouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript Asynchronous Programming:</strong> Understanding Promises, 
              async/await, and handling API calls efficiently is an ongoing learning process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> Building confidence in writing tests 
              and systematically debugging complex issues.

            <p>
              Hey future Chidinma! ðŸ‘‹
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember when you couldn't center a div without Googling? Remember when 
              JavaScript closures felt like an impossible concept? Look at how far you've come!
            </p>
            <p>
              I know the journey hasn't been easy. There were late nights debugging, moments 
              of frustration when code didn't work, and times when imposter syndrome crept in. 
              But you kept going. You kept learning. You kept building.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never forget why you started: to create technology that helps people, to build 
              accessible experiences for everyone, and to prove to yourself that you can master 
              anything you set your mind to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep that curiosity alive. Keep asking questions. Keep building things that matter. 
              And most importantly, remember to celebrate your winsâ€”both big and small.
            </p>
            <p>
              You've got this! ðŸ’ªâœ¨

        <!-- Extra Thoughts Section -->
        <section data-testid="test-about-extra" class="about-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Additional Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout this journey, I've learned valuable lessons that go beyond code:
          </p>
          <ul class="extra-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Consistency Over Intensity:</strong> Coding for 30 minutes daily beats 
              cramming for hours once a week. Small, consistent efforts compound over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community Matters:</strong> Learning to code doesn't have to be a solo 
              journey. Asking questions, helping others, and being part of a community makes 
              the process more enjoyable and effective.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Document Everything:</strong> Writing down what I learn not only helps 
              me remember but also helps others who might face similar challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Embrace the Struggle:</strong> Every error message is a teacher. Every 
              bug fixed is a victory. The struggle is part of the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build Projects You Care About:</strong> Passion fuels persistence. When 
              you're building something meaningful to you, it's easier to push through challenges.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="closing-message">
            To anyone reading this who's also learning to code: You're not alone. We're all 
            figuring this out together. Keep going, keep learning, and rememberâ€”every expert 
            was once a beginner. You've got this! ðŸš€
